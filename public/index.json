	"content": "Why do we need AMIs? Reproduce configurations easily - Once you have an instance configured the way you want, with all necessary software, settings etc., you can create an AMI from it. Then launching new instances from that AMI ensures all instances have the same baseline configuration automatically. Standardize environments - AMIs help maintain consistency across your environments. For example, you may have an AMI configured for a web server role that contains the necessary web server software and configurations. All new web server instances would use this standardized AMI. Backup and recovery - AMIs act as machine snapshots that can be used for backup, disaster recovery or to reproduce instances that may have failed. If an existing instance fails or needs to be replaced, launching a new one from the AMI is quicker than reconfiguring from scratch. Auto scaling - When using auto scaling groups to dynamically scale your fleet size based on demand, AMIs ensure all new instances added by auto scaling have the required configuration already in place.

Then the servers in the Web tier will call APIs to the Interal Load Balancer. Load Balancer will then forward traffic to servers in the App tier. Finally, the servers in the App tier will process the request, retrieve data in the Data tier (if necessary) and return results to users in the Web tier.

	"content": "Introduction to three-tier architecture The three-tier architecture is the most popular implementation of a multi-tier architecture and consists of a single presentation tier, logic tier, and data tier. The following illustration shows an example of a simple, generic three-tier application.\nThree-tier architecture includes:\nPresentation tier / Web Tier: interface layer so users can interact directly (eg: website or mobile application UI). Logic tier / App tier: layer to process logic and execute user commands. Data tier: data storage layer of the app. Advantages of implementing three-tier architecture:\nModularity: this architecture helps us modularize the app into independent parts. This helps the dev team focus on developing each layer of the app, resulting in changes being applied as quickly as possible. In addition, it also helps recover the app faster after the server is down due to an error or disaster thanks to being able to localize and repair the faulty part. High availability: because the architecture deploys applications across multiple Availability Zones, the AZs are designed so that there is no failure that affects 2 AZs at the same time (fault isolation). High redundancy: AWS allows deploying a stand by or replica version of the primary database on the remaining AZ. If the main database is down, the application can still retrieve data from the replica database. "

	"content": "Create Launch Template Launch templates and AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are both fundamental for launching EC2 instances on AWS, but they serve different purposes:\nAMI (Amazon Machine Image): An AMI is a template that captures the entire software environment of a running EC2 instance. It includes the operating system, applications, configurations, and data volumes. AMIs act as blueprints for creating new instances with the same software setup. You can think of them as pre-configured snapshots of a virtual machine. Launch Template: A launch template defines the configuration details needed to launch an EC2 instance. This includes the AMI ID (which specifies the software environment), instance type (hardware capabilities), security groups (network access rules), user data (scripts to run on instance startup), and other launch parameters. It essentially defines how an instance will be provisioned beyond the base software provided by the AMI. Here\u0026rsquo;s an analogy: Imagine an AMI as a recipe for a cake, specifying the ingredients (operating system, applications). A launch template would be like the baking instructions, including the oven temperature (instance type), baking time, and any additional steps (user data scripts). You can use the same cake recipe (AMI) with different baking instructions (launch templates) to create cakes with variations (different instance configurations).\nCreate Launch Template In the EC2 dashboard, select Launch templates in the sidebar, then click Create launch template In the launch template creation interface, under Launch template name and description, fill in Launch template name as AppTier-LaunchTemplate Under the AMI selection, choose Owned by me then select AppTierImage Choose Instance type as t2.micro Keypair to Don’t include in launch template Network settings:\nSubnet to Don’t include in launch template SG to existing sg, then select AppTier-SG Advanced details, IAM instance profile to ec2role Scroll down to the bottom, select Create launch template.

After creating the folder, we upload the jar file just created by dragging and dropping it into the folder !\nBefore downloading s3 to the instance, we need to make s3 public by adding a policy to it:\nSelect the s3 bucket created, go to the tab permission In Bucket policy select edit and paste the following code, then click Save changes {\r\u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [\r{\r\u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PublicReadGetObject\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::demowebapp-workshop-01/*\u0026#34;\r}\r]\r} Access the jar file in the bucket and copy the Object URL of it In the session manager, run the command sudo wget (sudo wget https://demowebapp-workshop-01.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/library-app-be/library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) to download the jar file to the instance Run the command java -jar library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to run the app on the instance To be able to temporarily test with Postman, we can temporarily assign public-route-table (for the purpose of being able to use IGW) to private-subnet-1 (subnet containing ec2 instance) Access postman, we can use Public IPv4 address or Public IPv4 DNS to call the APIs use Public IPv4 address use Public IPv4 DNS To keep the app running even after terminating the session, we can use nohup command. For example, nohup java -jar library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \u0026amp;. Then we can close the session and the app will still run. To stop the app, we can run pkill -f 'java -jar library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' But we need to make the app automatically run after the instance is rebooted. We will use systemd to do create service for the app (run java app as a service)\nWe will run the following commands: sudo chmod +x /home/ec2-user/library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/library.service Insert the code below into your-application.service:\n[Unit]\rDescription=Java Application as a Service\rAfter=syslog.target\r[Service]\rUser=ec2-user\rExecStart=ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /home/ec2-user/library-app-be-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\rSuccessExitStatus=143\r[Install]\rWantedBy=multi-user.target cd /etc/systemd/system/ sudo chmod 777 library.service sudo nano library.service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable library.service sudo systemctl start library.service sudo systemctl status library.service -l sudo systemctl stop library.service "
